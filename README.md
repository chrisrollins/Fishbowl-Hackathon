### Fishbowl-Hackathon's *Best App In Everyday Solutions Category*
---
## Together
###### Together is an social web-app that uses Fishbowl's restaurants' data and analytics to help restaurants fill in their slow time. And how do we fill in these slow times? We use Fishbowl's customers database to match those who are different in backgrounds such as ethnicity, race, gender, sexual-preference etc., to dine together at restaurants that have joined our program. Participants get to socialize, increase exposure to differences and step out of their bubbles. And the end of the dining experience, participants simply show the QR code sent their e-mail and a discount will be applied to their bill.  
###### Together benefits both restaurants and customers: restaurants get to fill in their designated slow times and advertise, and customers can meet new people with a cause and a discount. As Together grows we will be able to monetize the service and further build it to become a social-network.
